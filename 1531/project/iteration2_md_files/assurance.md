Using postman, most of the backend functions appear to work. We know this because requests are successful, and the yaml file gets updated with each request. The acceptance criteria (which was outlined in iteration 1) is also met as ValueError and AccessErrors are raised if the user does not input the data correctly. A user is verified via a token, and all tokens are stored in a list in the yaml file. If a user inputs an incorrect token, it will not be in the list, thus an AccessError will be raised. For validation, each user has a permission_id, and functions that require certain permission raise AccessErrors if the permission_id is not correct.
